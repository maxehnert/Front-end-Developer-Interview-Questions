* Explain AJAX in as much detail as possible.
 - Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
 - It is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with server-side scripts. 
 - It can send as well as receive information in a variety of formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and even text files. 
 - AJAXâ€™s most appealing characteristic, however, is its "asynchronous" nature, which means it can do all of this without having to refresh the page. This lets you update portions of a page based upon user events.

* Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really AJAX).
 - JSON-P works by making a `<script>` element (either in HTML markup or inserted into the DOM via JavaScript), which requests to a remote data service location. 
 - The response (the loaded "JavaScript" content) is the name of a function pre-defined on the requesting web page, with the parameter being passed to it being the JSON data being requested. 
 - When the script executes, the function is called and passed the JSON data, allowing the requesting page to receive and process the data.
