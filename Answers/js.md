#### JS Questions:

* Explain event delegation
 - Event delegation allows us to attach a single event listener, to a parent element, that will fire for all descendants matching a selector, whether those descendants exist now or are added in the future.

* Explain how `this` works in JavaScript
 - In the global execution context (outside of any function), `this` refers to the global object, whether in strict mode or not.
 - Inside a function, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called.
 - When a function is called as a method of an object, its `this` is set to the object the method is called on.
 - When a function is used as a constructor (with the new keyword), its `this is bound to new object being constructed.
 - When a function is used as an event handler, its `this` is set to the element the event fired from

* Explain how prototypal inheritance works
 - In JavaScript, any function can be added to an object in the form of a property. An inherited function acts just as any other property
 - When an inherited function is executed, the value of this points to the inheriting object, not to the prototype object where the function is an own property.

* How do you go about testing your JavaScript?
 - unit tests
 - end to end tests
* What do you think of AMD vs CommonJS?
* Explain why the following doesn't work as an IIFE: `function foo(){ }();`.
  * What needs to be changed to properly make it an IIFE?
* What's the difference between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined` or `undeclared`?
 - `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value
 - `null` is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value
 - A variable is `undeclared` when it does not use the var keyword
  * How would you go about checking for any of these states?
* What is a closure, and how/why would you use one?
 - Closures are functions that refer to independent (free) variables. In other words, the function defined in the closure remembers the environment in which it was created.
 - Much of the code we write in web JavaScript is event-based â€” we define some behavior, then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). Our code is generally attached as a callback: a single function which is executed in response to the event

* What's a typical use case for anonymous functions?
* How do you organize your code? (module pattern, classical inheritance?)
* What's the difference between host objects and native objects?
* Difference between: `function Person(){}`, `var person = Person()`, and `var person = new Person()`?
* What's the difference between `.call` and `.apply`?
* Explain `Function.prototype.bind`.
* When would you use `document.write()`?
* What's the difference between feature detection, feature inference, and using the UA string?

* Explain how JSONP works (and how it's not really AJAX).
* Have you ever used JavaScript templating?
  * If so, what libraries have you used?
* Explain "hoisting".
* Describe event bubbling.
* What's the difference between an "attribute" and a "property"?
* Why is extending built in JavaScript objects not a good idea?
* Difference between document load event and document ready event?
* What is the difference between `==` and `===`?
* Explain the same-origin policy with regards to JavaScript.
* Make this work:
```javascript
duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]
```
* Why is it called a Ternary expression, what does the word "Ternary" indicate?
* What is `"use strict";`? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?
* Create a for loop that iterates up to `100` while outputting **"fizz"** at multiples of `3`, `"buzz"` at multiples of `5` and **"fizzbuzz"** at multiples of `3` and `5`
* Why is it, in general, a good idea to leave the global scope of a website as-is and never touch it?
* Why would you use something like the `load` event? Does this event have disadvantages? Do you know any alternatives, and why would you use those?
* Explain what a single page app is and how to make one SEO-friendly.
* What is the extent of your experience with Promises and/or their polyfills?
