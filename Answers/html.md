#### HTML Questions:

* What does a `doctype` do?
  - `<!DOCTYPE>` informs the browser which version of HTML is being used. Doctype is a declaration, not a tag.

* What's the difference between standards mode and quirks mode?
  - quirks mode, layout emulates nonstandard behavior in Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5 for Windows that is required not to break existing content on the Web. 
  - full standards mode, the behavior is (hopefully) the behavior described by the HTML and CSS specifications. 
  - almost standards mode, there are only a very small number of quirks implemented.

* How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?
  - Always use a language attribute on the html element. This is inherited by all other elements, and so will set a default language for the text in the document head element.
  - create metadata that describes the language of the intended audience of a page, rather than the language of a specific range of text, do so by getting the server to send the information in the HTTP Content-Language header.

  - Text In Images Wonâ€™t Scale
  - Restrictive Word / Sentence length
  - How Colors Are Perceived Across Different Cultures

* What are `data-` attributes good for?
  -  data-* attributes allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as classList, non-standard attributes, extra properties on DOM, or setUserData.

* Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?
* Describe the difference between a `cookie`, `sessionStorage` and `localStorage`.
* Describe the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>` and `<script defer>`.
* Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS `<link>`s between `<head></head>` and JS `<script>`s just before `</body>`? Do you know any exceptions?
* What is progressive rendering?
